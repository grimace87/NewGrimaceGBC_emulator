## About
The program uses the Windows API and OpenGL to create an environment on a Windows PC to play a GameBoy game, using keyboard as input and displaying the game in a resizeable window.
C++ object-oriented code is used to implement an emulator object, which simulates the GameBoy's Z80-like CPU, along with its memory structure and other components. Audio emulation is currently very, very disappointing.
The program is not distributed with any ROM (game) files. Games that were published or distributed by Nintendo are owned by Nintendo, and their distribution or ownership may be illegal in some regions. I do not encourage any unlawful acquisition or distribution of any property owned by Nintendo or another company.
